Historical note: Eon's Disease had the power to \"spread\"; FFG's change to \"contagion\" is a weaker fit, and the game text's statement that you infect that player does not make sense: the player had to be already infected before this power could even be used, when Disease got his first colony in that system.

The original theme made perfect sense and did not need to be tinkered with.

Any time you must send ships of your choice to the warp (e.g., when failing to make a deal), just select any that are petrified, then choose to keep them on that planet instead of losing them. Or, to get out from under Gorgon's influence whenever you are allowed to select ships to move (e.g., when populating the hyperspace gate), select some that are petrified and move them to the warp instead of their intended destination. This also leads to ambiguity since it is not always clear, when ships are being sent to the warp, which player is technically the one who \"attempts to move\" them. It is likely that these changes were unintended, and so the revised wording presented here restores Mayfair's original effect, with tweaks to account for captured and eradicated ships.

Unfortunately, FFG's decision to place the timing of Will's choice in the Launch phase rather than the (cleaner) Destiny phase causes issues (such as Disease needing to know where he can spread when Will draws a wild destiny) and poses a discontinuity that some future game effects may need to be carefully written around. In addition, FFG's version of Will cannot reclaim an empty home planet after drawing his own color; his power always forces him to choose another player to be the defense. Eon's Wild Will was completely different: it allowed the player to dictate the terms of a deal when other players failed to make one.
